# statsummary

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of statsummary is to compute summary statistics (mean, median, minimum, maximum, count) on a numeric variable grouped by a categorical variable.

## Installation

statsummary is not yet on CRAN. You can install the development version of statsummary like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("eamutaigwe/statsummary")
```

## Example

Summarize_data() is a function that helps to carry out a fairly common task on a dataset which quickly computes summary statistics (mean, median, minimum, maximum, and count) on a numeric variable grouped by a categorical variable.

It produces a list object with two items- a tibble or data frame containing summary statistics on a numeric variable grouped by a categorical variable, and a ggplot object- a boxplot which visually presents some of the summary statistics found in the summary table generated such as median, minimum, maximum, and count.

Below is a basic example which shows you how to use the function:

```{r example}
library(statsummary)
summarize_data(gapminder::gapminder, continent, lifeExp)
```


summarize_data() is designed to always group by a categorical variable. So, if you decide to group by a numeric variable, it would throw an error. An error message is also returned if your `y` variable is categorical.

```{r error=TRUE}
summarize_data(gapminder::gapminder, gdpPercap, lifeExp)
```
